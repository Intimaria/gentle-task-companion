# Gentle Task Companion 
## A gentle, privacy-focused task and mood companion app


## ðŸ’› About this project

This app was created as a weekend self-care project to support mental health, especially for neurodivergent people like myself.  
It helps track tasks, moods, gratitude, and includes features like relaxing sounds and communication cards.  
I built it with accessibility and simplicity in mind.

If you'd like to contribute, offer feedback, or just try it â€” you're warmly invited.

## RELEASE STATUS

####  Early Alpha/Beta â€” For Testing Only


This is an early, in-development version of Gentle Task Companion. Please be aware of the following:

- **Testing Phase:** This release is for testing and feedback. Features, data structures, and user experience may change at any time.
- **Limited Capacity:** The app is not yet production-ready. Data loss, bugs, and downtime are possible.
- **No Encryption:** All input text (tasks, mood, gratitude, crisis contacts, etc.) is stored as plain text in the database. There is currently no end-to-end encryption. Do not enter sensitive or private information.
- **Privacy:** While the app is designed to be privacy-focused, please use caution and review the code if you have concerns.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Built with Next.js, React, and Supabase for backend storage.
  - Data is stored per user (anonymous authentication is enabled) and grouped by local date.
  - No third-party analytics or tracking is included.
  - All user-facing strings are internationalized (English/Spanish).
  - The app is open source and licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

By using this app, you acknowledge the above limitations and risks. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Local Database Setup (for Testing)

This app was setup to connect to a Supabase instance and uses environment variables in Vercel to authorize the connection. 

In theory you can test locally with a self-hosted database instance, but this hasn't been tested by me. 

To try:

- Update your environment variables (e.g., `.env.local`) with the correct database connection string for your local instance.
- Make sure your database schema matches the appâ€™s requirements (I exported the supabase projectâ€™s schema if that helps).
- Restart the development server after updating your environment variables.

Use docker for local testing:

```bash
docker run --name gentle-task-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

### Running Schema Migrations 

If you want to apply the schema (`schema.sql`) to your local Postgres (e.g., running in Docker), use the following command (replace with your own values if different):


```sh
docker exec -i gentle-task-db psql -U postgres -d postgres < schema.sql
```

This will apply all schema changes to your local database. Make sure your container is running and `schema.sql` is in your current directory.


## Technology 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
